                            first released in 1972, was as simple as a game can possibly be. Two white rectangles batting a square ball black back and forward as players attempted to win points off each other. It tested reflexes and nerves and introduced an exciting new medium to millions.Most importantly it turned pal against pal or sibling against sibling in a sport of friendly or fierce competition. That's something the gaming industry is still doing to the delight of milions to this day. Video games have come a long way since Pong though.

                            This old stereotype of gamers being isolated loners is quite frankly boring and outdated.Video games have long since come out of the bedroom and into the world. Shared and celebrated by fans and communities across the globle.Here are six more of the iconic titles that helped make that happen.

                            Around five years after Pong, Space Invaders was launched, bringing with it more colours, more sophiticated music and a distinctive plot and mood.While sceptics dismissed Pong as a passing novelty Space Invaders proved that video games were not only here to stay but they were a massive and extremely profitable global industry.And the little pixelated enemies are still used to this day as an icon video games as a whole.

                            Waka-waka-ing his way onto the scene in 1980, Pac-man was arguably video gaming's first real character. Urban legend states that his shape was inspired by a pizza minus a couple of slices. Pac-man tried something different. In it you had to use your wits and strategically evade enemies until you were strong enough to chase them down instead. Pac-man quickly bacame a pop culture phenomenon featuring on t-shirts, ties, glasses, bags, balloons, board, games, books, caps and any other merchandise that sat around in one spot for too long.

                            Of all the video game characters to grace our consoles over the years, none have made an impact quite like Mario. The side-scrolling platform game featured a plumber trying to rescue a princess from a fire-breathing turtle and a labyrinth of pipes and platforms to traverse while avoiding razor-toothed plants and even odder-looking mushrooms. And so of course it captured gamers' hearts and became one of the fastest-sellikng video games of all time.
